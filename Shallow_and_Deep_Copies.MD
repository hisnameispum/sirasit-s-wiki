## Shallow Copy

## Deep Copy
Deep copy is a process in which the copying process occurs recursively.  
It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child  
objects found in the original. In case of deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object. It means that  
any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object. In python, this is implemented using “deepcopy()” function.
