## Repository
```
Origin -> Your local repository  
Upstream -> Official repository  
```
## Good Practice
Don't work on main. Create a branch, work on it, and then merge later.  
```
git branch [name]  
```
## Switch to another branch
```git checkout [name]```

## Show current status
```git status```

## See difference
```git diff```

## Combine to current version
```git rebase [name]```

## Push
```git push [remote] [branch]```

## List out remotes
```git remote -v```

## Cancel merge
```git merge --abort```
